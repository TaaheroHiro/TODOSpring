# TODOSpring
Simple Application to have an idea how springboot works.

The TODO application functions are create,update and delete. Added bonus is the analytical page that shows a bar chart of created and completed items.

This project creates and uses a SQLLite DB as a simple local way of tracking todo items. 
This can be done via a online SQL DB but for tests purposes and to not incur costs its made locally.
No custom schma is used for the DB but the DB is locally generated using TODO Model.
